## 🛍️ Snap2Shop: Image-Based Product Recommendation System  

Snap2Shop is a **Deep Learning-powered** product recommendation system that finds **visually similar** products from an image. Using **ResNet50** and **feature embeddings**, it matches the uploaded image with a database of products.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Upload an image and get **similar product recommendations**  
✔ Uses **ResNet50** for feature extraction  
✔ Efficient **image similarity search** with embeddings  
✔ Supports **large-scale product datasets**  

---


## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV)  
- **Deep Learning** (ResNet50, Feature Embeddings)  
- **Streamlit** (Frontend for user interaction)  
- **FAISS / Nearest Neighbors** (Fast image retrieval)

## 🔥 Quick Start  
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2️⃣ Extract Image Features  
```bash
python feature_extractor.py
```
### 3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App  
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Extract Features:** Uses **ResNet50** (without the top layer) to create feature embeddings for images.  
2️⃣ **Store Features:** Saves embeddings in `embeddings.pkl` for fast retrieval.  
3️⃣ **Find Similar Products:** Uses **cosine similarity** to recommend similar items.  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements  
✅ Train on a **fashion-specific dataset** (e.g., DeepFashion)  
✅ Use **CLIP** or **Swin Transformer** for better embeddings  
✅ Deploy as a **web API**
